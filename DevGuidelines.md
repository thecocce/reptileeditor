# Development Guidelines #

The following are some development guidelines to promote consistency across the project.

## Coding ##

  * Use Enums rather than integer constants
  * Use tabs for indentation, not spaces
  * Use 1TBS (The One True Brace Style) for blocks of code, i.e.
```
public void method() {
    //Some code
}
```
  * Javadoc comments should be used on every class, method and public field
